### Profile

**Update:** This summer, I'll go to [**Stanford University**](http://cs.stanford.edu/), [**HCI Group**](http://hci.stanford.edu/) for  summer research assistantship intern, and work with Prof. [**Michael Bernstein**](http://hci.stanford.edu/msb/).

**Update:** Starting in 2015, I'll be joining Ph.D in Computer Science at [**University of Colorado Boulder**](http://www.colorado.edu/cs/), [**Human-Centered Computing lab**](http://hcc.colorado.edu/), and work with Prof. [**Tom Yeh**](http://tomyeh.info/).

</br>

My name is Ryo Suzuki.
I am currently a Ph.D student at [**University of Tokyo**](http://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/), and working with Prof. [**Koji Yatani**](http://yatani.jp/) at [**IIS Lab**](http://iis-lab.org/).
I received my B.Eng from Tokyo Institute of Technology, and M.A from University of Tokyo in 2011 and 2013 respectively.

My main research interest is in **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**.
I am particularly interested in user interface design for collaborative learning, prototyping toolkit for personal fabrication, and social networks of open source communities.
