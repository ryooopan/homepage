# Fun Projects


### 3D Deformation [[GitHub](https://github.com/ryosuzuki/cad-app)]

This is a class project for CSCI-5229 Computer Graphics.
I implemented a standard ARAP deformation algorithm with OpenGL.

### Kinect-based Character Animation [[Project Site](https://techsportplay2016.wordpress.com/2016/05/02/final-project-report-easy-drawing-animation/)]

This is a class project for CSCI-7000 Technology for Sports and Play taught by Mark Gross.
The goal of this project is to make an anmiation easier and more intuitive.
To achieve this goal, I use a Kinect to detect the human motion and make a character animation by synchronizing with the body movement.
You can find more details about this prototype [here](https://techsportplay2016.wordpress.com/2016/05/02/final-project-report-easy-drawing-animation/).

### Easy Drawing Animation [[Project Site](https://techsportplay2016.wordpress.com/2016/02/15/easy-drawing-animation-2/)]

This is just a fun prototype that turns hand-drawn sketch into kinetic animation based on the real-time face tracking.

Here is a concept video behind this idea.

### Object Recognition with Neural Netowrk

This is a class project for CSCI-5722 Computer Vision.
I implemented an object recognition and classification with the CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) trained with the ImageNet dataset.
I adopt the VGG-16 neural network (ILSRC 2014 winner), which consists of 16 weight layers.
By using this model, the program can automatically label the image (e.g., pig, computer screen, ruggby ball, toy poodle, etc) just like Google Photos.
