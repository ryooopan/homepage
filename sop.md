Research Statement
My primary research interest is in the area of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). I believe that one of the most important challenges in HCI for the next decade would be in programming education with emphasis on collaborative learning [practical use/project-based programming education]. In the past few years, as many educational tools provide a new way to learn how to code interactively, it has been easier for a novice learner to attain the basics knowledge of programming. However, there is still a huge gap between acquiring basic knowledge and putting it to practical use. For example, mastering the basics of JavaScript has been relatively easy, on the other hand, building a practical web application with JavaScript is still hard without. This is mainly because [teaching the way to combine is more difficult/The difficulty of bridging the gap is that they needs to have not only a various sample applications, but also tutorials for them.] 
My research goal is to fill this gap by designing a web-based educational platform/tool that closely integrated with its users community. The both community and tool design are equally important since [community needs to provide a various examples that might intrigue users and educational tool needs to provide how to build complex applications like Scratch.] To achieve this goal, during my PhD, I plan to focus on developing user interface of web-based learning environment and its tutorial generator.

Research Experience 
The motivation behind this research goal comes from my personal experience in	 Mitaka dormitory. I built a programmer community, called Mitakalab, with students who have different backgrounds. One of the project we worked was the automated watering device with remote monitoring of the moisture level of the plant. This project is built with the combination of different technologies such as Arduino, Node.js, and WebSocket. [I was amazed that I can create new things that I never thought about just by combining knowledge.] 知識はすでに持っていたけど、それを組み合わせることで、こんな新しいものが作れる、なんていうことに驚いた。 Through this experience, I learned that it is quite important to apply one’s knowledge to create something new. I also learned the community plays an important role in combining knowledge by sharing knowledge. Since then, I have had a strong interest in 

To understand social behavior in a community, I have studied social science through undergraduate and graduate research. After taking several graduate economics and mathematics courses, I did research on social networks and game theory under the supervision of Prof. Michihiro Kandori. I applied my knowledge of game theory to explain how an online platform like YouTube and Twitter spreads among people, and how its user community forms over time. We found that activity (engagement) rate of early adopters [初期のユーザーがどのくらい集まるか] has a crucial role in increasing the number of its users and contents. We showed that our results are robust to time-series data collected from an experimental online application. The paper later got accepted at The 10th Conference on Web and Internet Economics (WINE 2014). For further understanding of social behavior, I have worked on incentive design as a next research. I investigated the incentive structure of GitHub collaboration, and found that the visibility of users’ contribution has a positive impact on the incentive to join and contribute to the developer community. Through the series of research, I learned the importance of community design.

I have been working on designing web-based educational tool. It is difficult for beginners of programming to get the point of huge source code, on the other hand, creating up-to-date document is annoying task. To solve this problem, I developed the tool that helps programmer to create step-by-step and up-to-date tutorials by drag-and-dop code annotation. Cumiki makes it easier to share the knowledge behind source code and accelerate project-based learning within the group. I also developed interactive video tutorial. This tool makes it possible to record the users' keyboard typing and automatically generate video tutorial. Learner can not only watch the process of coding, but also learn to code in browser interactively. These projects were well received in some demo competitions including finalist at TechCrunch Tokyo, 1st prize at University of Tokyo Entrepreneur Dojo, and Microsoft Award at Business Model Competition. 

Currently, 
Becoming aware of potential research opportunity, I decided to do research on this issue. I am currently working on several projects under the supervision of Prof. Koji Yatani. One is the IDE for making programming instruction. My current project supports teachers to create effective instruction. I am also working on information visualization toolkit for non-programmers. I plan to submit future research to the top conference like UIST 2015 with further experiments and user study.
Moreover, To better prepare myself for PhD program of UW, I have taken courses about computer science including Web Engineering, Ubiquitous Computing, Information Visualization, and Machine Learning as well as Design of Learning Environment. I have also acquired solid practical programming skills by working as a software engineer over two years. In addition, I have gotten accepted as a research intern at Viewpoints Research Institute led by Dr. Alan Kay, and I plan to accumulate research experience on HCI.

Why University of Washington
University of Washington Information School is the best place to pursue my research goal stated above, since DUB group does challenging and interdisciplinary work which really matches my interest. At iSchool, Prof. Andrew Ko  is working on the research problems related to programming education. Most of Prof. Ko's research are in the area of programming education. Gidget is one of the project that Prof. Ko and his PhD student is currently working on. His other projects including Jasper also fit for my research interest. I am also interested in Prof. Jacob Wobbrock and Prof. Jessica Hullman.

Conclusion
As I stated above, I am confident that my diverse research experience, unique backgrounds, and solid programming skills would contribute to research group at UW. program. I also believe that University of Washington will surely help me realize my dream of contributing to HCI research.

Through my research, I want to make it easier for people with different backgrounds to acquire practical software skills, and to leverage their knowledge.
