My primary research objective and interest is in the area of Human Computer Interaction.
I believe that one of the most important issue in HCI for the next decade would be in 
incubating user-driven innovation. 

 [exploring a effective way of incubating innovative product] . My research goal is to make a significant contribution to establish the way of effective collaboration by combining design thinking, rapid prototyping, and expertise sharing. As a stepping-stone to achieve this ultimate goal, I plan to focus on the following three specific research areas in my PhD research: user interface design for programming education, a toolkit design for rapid prototyping, and community development for software and hardware engineering.

# Motivation 
The motivation behind this research goal comes from my personal experience in Mitaka dormitory where I build a programmer community, called Mitakalab, with some friends who have a common interest in programming. As the community grew and the students’ expertise were diversified, the diversified products were invented; the web and mobile application with NASA’s crater data, bicycle electronic generator, and automatic water-pomp. These projects could never be incubated without a collaboration between different background such as aerospace engineering, agriculture, and electronic and computer engineering. Through this experience, I learned the power of collaboration, and at the same time, the difficulty to facilitate effective collaboration. Since then, I made a decision to do research in this issue [What is “this issue”?] from the viewpoint of social science and human computer interaction.

# Research and Academic Background ## Online user community
Building an successful community plays an important role in effective education not only In the sense of helping with each other, but also in stimulating one’s creativity.
For example, Scratch, which is a programming educational IDE for children, has a very active users' community, and its community enable users to share its project and inspire others’ projects. 
In the past several years, as a economic graduate student, I apply my social science knowledge to analyze human behavior in an online community. In my master’s thesis, I did research on the growth of the online community with the game theoretical model under the supervision of Prof. Michihiro Kandori. While previous research including Young (2009) can describe a diffusion curve know as S-shaped curve, these models has a limitation in predicting the difference between thriving and flopped community (like Twitter and the other closed microblog platforms) My contribution is to prove there are a threshold that divide into multiple paths which represents a success and a failure in expanding. To extend the research, I substantiating the model with actual time-series user data. To gather data that fit the model settings, I developed an music recommendation platform where people share their music recommendation. Therefore, my model gives a better prediction for users’ behavior, and the paper later get accepted at WINE 2014. I am currently working on the incentive of collaboration in open source community like GitHub. The paper implies the visibility of users’ contribution has a positive impact on the incentive to join and contribute to the developer community.

## Programing education 

The most successful online community could be open source community.
After submitting the paper, I have been working on the collaboration 



IDE for Programming education

My future research goal is to build a community where people interact each other and create innovative products through its collaboration. 
To achieve this goal, I believe developing an innovative tool that facilitate people to learn programming easily. If the cost for learning programming are going down, the more and more people can take part in the collaboration, and as a result, the more innovation will happen.
For example, Scratch, one of the most successful programming education tool for children, provide the development environment, but also offers the place where users can share their products. The community become a source of inspiration.
I believe the most difficult thing to learn is not to learn to code but to come up with the idea. In order to give an inspire, building community is important as well as the software tool itself.





Why University of Washington
University of Washington is the best place to pursue my research goal stated above, since DUB group does challenging and interdisciplinary work which really matches my interest. At iSchool, Prof. Andrew Ko  is working on the research problems related to programming education. Most of Prof. Ko's research are in the area of programming education. Gidget is one of the project that Prof. Ko and his PhD student is currently working on. His paper including ICER’11 and — is the best fit for my research interest.
I am also interested in Prof. Jessica Hullman’s research, especially related to investigating the factors involved in making sense of data , information visualization.

My Career Objective 
My short term objective in University of Washington are to make an tool and to publish a number of top conference papers including CHI, UIST, and CSCW. My ultimate career goal is to be an outstanding researcher in human computer interaction and to apply knowledge and skills to make innovative tool that will be used for programming education all over the world. I would like to make a significant contribution to human computer interaction in the future and I believe that University of Washington will surely help my ambition. I am also confident that my knowledge and experience of both social science and computer science will contribute to your program. I earnestly ask for your favorable consideration in accepting me.
