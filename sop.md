My primary research objective and interest is in the area of Human Computer Interaction.
I believe that one of the most important issue in HCI for the next decade would be in the programming education and its learning community.
Through my research, I want to make it easier for people to learn to code, and to prototype something innovative products with the power of community.


My interest in the learning community comes from my personal experience in Mitaka dormitory where I and some friends who have a common interest in coding made a decision to build a programmer community called Mitakalab. We used to gather together every week and code to create some application. As a variety of students get involved in Mitakalab, the products we made became also diversified. We naturally collaborate with each other and our different background in the community like agriculture, astronomy, and education and created something we never did alone. 
This is the first time I experienced the power of collaboration. And I also found myself acquiring various skills and knowledge from software to hardware development much more than in classes and with textbooks. 
Programming education is important not only in acquiring skills and knowledge, but also in release one’s potential creativity.
It has been more and more easy to acquire basic knowledge and skills in programming. However, the difficulty lies in how to combine a knowledge and to stir imagination. 
Through this experience, I learned a power of collaboration in the community could be the breakthrough solution.
(Since then, my research goal has been applying my knowledge and skills to understand innovative collaboration and developing its programming education )


## Research and academic background 

Online user community
Building an successful community plays an important role in effective education not only In the sense of helping with each other, but also in stimulating one’s creativity.
For example, Scratch, which is a programming educational IDE for children, has a very active users' community, and its community enable users to share its project and inspire others’ projects.
In the past several years, as a economic graduate student, I apply my social science knowledge to analyze human behavior in an online community. 
In my master’s thesis, I did research on the growth of the online community with the game theoretical model under the supervision of Prof. Michihiro Kandori.
While previous research including Young (2009) can describe a diffusion curve know as S-shaped curve, these models has a limitation in predicting the difference between thriving and flopped community (like Twitter and the other closed microblog platforms)
My contribution is to prove there are a threshold that divide into multiple paths which represents a success and a failure in expanding, and then I presented the paper at AMTW 2012.
To extend the research, I substantiating the model with actual time-series user data. To gather data that fit the model settings, I developed an music recommendation platform where people share their music recommendation. Therefore, my model gives a better prediction for users’ behavior, and the paper later get accepted at WINE 2014.

My primary research interest lies in developing tools for programming education and understanding its learning community.

Since I got involved in developer community in the dormitory, I have had a strong interest in programming education and its learning community. When I lived in the dormitory, I and some friends have a common interest in coding and we used to gather together every weekend to code. As the various students got involved in the community, I had an interesting experience. Since each of us has a different background, we collaborated and prototyped various things from an automated plant watering device to bicycle electricity generator integrated with web and mobile application. I could not imagine before that I can make such a things.
Even though our community purpose is not in teaching and learning programming, I learned skills and knowledge of software development and electronic engineering much more than in classes or with textbooks.
This experience of that time had a great influence on my life. Since then, my research interest has lie in how innovation happens with collaboration, how the knowledge gap should be filled, and how the prototyping would be accelerated with the educational tools. My research goal is to understand the nature of community and to provide a toolkit that accelerates collaboration among the community. To achieve this goal, I look forward to undertaking doctoral study at University of Washington, as a significant stepping-stone in my professional career.

To understand a community, I studied social science as a framework for analysis of human behavior. When I was undergraduate student, I majored in social engineering and acquire skills and knowledge of mathematical modeling and social science. After graduating, I entered in graduate school of economics at University of Tokyo. In my master’s thesis, I did research about the human behavior in a community, and especially focused on the growth of the online  community. In this paper, I developed an economic model that describe diffusion process. The contribution of the model is to prove there are a threshold that divide into multiple paths which represents a success and a failure. (AMTW 2012). Moreover, in order to substantiate the model, I developed music community platform and gather the time-series user data via Facebook API. The data suggest the model’s simulation fit better than the existing model. I submitted the paper to WINE 2014. I am currently working on the incentive of collaboration in open source community like GitHub. The paper implies the visibility of users’ contribution has a positive impact on the incentive to join and contribute to the developer community.

My strength is not only I have research experience in social science, but also I have experience in user interface development for programming education. 
I developed an educational programming tool called Cumiki, that enable users to annotate and create instruction of the code. This project aims to help to read and understand the code on GitHub, and as a result, fill the gap in the skills between members of a community. Next project called Interactive Video Tutorial is also made for learning to code more easily and interactively. These projects were prized in some demo competition including TechCrunch Tokyo. As I became more invested in the user interface development of educational tools, I pursue in creating the new innovative way to learn and teach to code as a research. I am currently working on several projects in human computer interaction. One is the IDE for making programming instruction. My current project supports teachers to create effective instruction. I am also working on information visualization toolkit for non-programmers. I am working on these projects under the supervision of Prof. Koji Yatani since he joined to University of Tokyo this year, and working toward the top conference in HCI like UIST.

My future research goal is to build a community where people interact each other and create innovative products through its collaboration. To achieve this goal, I believe developing an innovative tool that facilitate people to learn programming easily. If the cost for learning programming are going down, the more and more people can take part in the collaboration, and as a result, the more innovation will happen.
For example, Scratch, one of the most successful programming education tool for children, provide the development environment, but also offers the place where users can share their products. The community become a source of inspiration.
I believe the most difficult thing to learn is not to learn to code but to come up with the idea. In order to give an inspire, building community is important as well as the software tool itself.

University of Washington is the best place to pursue my research goal since it has faculties whose interest matches my interest very well. I am especially interested in dub group. Dub group does quite interesting and challenging work which really matches my interest.For example, Prof Andrew Ko is working on the new way to learn programming such as Gidget. I understand this project is important in terms of reducing learning cost and giving enjoyable way to acquire coding skills. If I am admitted to the Information School of University of Washington, I would like to take part in challenging projects I mentioned above, and I would also like to take following courses which closely relate with my interest: - - - - -.
My short term objective in University of Washington are to make an tool and to publish a number of top conference papers including CHI, UIST, and CSCW. 

My ultimate career goal is to be an outstanding researcher in human computer interaction and to apply knowledge and skills to make innovative tool that will be used for programming education all over the world. I would like to make a significant contribution to human computer interaction in the future and I believe that University of Washington will surely help my ambition. I am also confident that my knowledge and experience of both social science and computer science will contribute to your program. I earnestly ask for your favorable consideration in accepting me.
