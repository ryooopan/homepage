￼I have had strong interest in collaboration and learning, since I did hackathon with my friends in the dormitory. In Mitaka dormitory, there are some students who were interested in developing software, so we sometimes got together and made some products. When we took part in the hackathon held by NASA, and we made application using space data. We learned a lot of things from each other through hackathon, since each of us had a different background, we could make products we never thought about and tackled a problem we never did alone. Through this experience, I found that working on a project with a group of people is the best way to enhance the potential and awaken the potential creativity. Since then, I have had strong interest in how collaboration occur. My long-term research goal is to provide a tool for collaboration.

Since I wanted to research collaboration and community, I majored in social engineering and economics. I learned human behavior and game theory there. My interest lies in how the community grows over time. In my master’s research, I worked on the diffusion process of online community in which people share their contents. I developed an economic model that explains how online communities grow over time. The contribution of this paper is to prove there are a threshold that divide into multiple paths which represents a success and a failure.

My strength is not only I have the knowledge and experience of social science, but also I have the experience developing software. In order to resolve the difficulty of understanding source code and help users share their knowledge, I developed an educational programming tool called Cumiki, that enable users to annotate on the code and create the instructive documentation of code. I also developed interactive video tutorial for teacher to instruct their code easily and interactively. Although I worked on these projects just because I tried to solve the problem that lies in knowledge sharing, as these projects was honored by some awards and prizes, I have had more and more interest in working on these theme as a research.

My future research goal is to build a community where people interact each other and create innovative products through its collaboration. To achieve this goal, I believe developing an innovative tool that facilitate people to learn programming easily. If the cost for learning programming are going down, the more and more people can take part in the collaboration, and as a result, the more innovation will happen.

For example, Scratch, one of the most successful programming education tool for children, provide the development environment, but also offers the place where users can share their products. The community become a source of inspiration.

I believe the most difficult thing to learn is not to learn to code but to come up with the idea. In order to give an inspire, building community is important as well as the software tool itself.
With my research background in social science, I am confident to do research both of developing user interface and understanding the user community. For example, my working paper about collaboration on GitHub, I showed that the more a community reveal users’ contribution, the more users get involved in and
￼contribute to the community. These solid knowledge and research experience helps me to do research programming education from the unique perspective.
Therefore, I am confident that I have solid knowledge of social science and acquired relevant skills, and I can make a significant contribution to University of Washington Information School with this unique background.

Since University of Washington has dub group, a strong human computer interaction group,
I am especially interested in dub group. Dub group does quite interesting and challenging work which really matches my interest.For example, Prof Andrew Ko is working on the new way to learn programming such as Gidget. I understand this project is important in terms of reducing learning cost and giving enjoyable way to acquire coding skills. If I am admitted to the Information School of University of Washington, I would like to take part in challenging projects I mentioned above, and I would also like to take following courses which closely relate with my interest:

My short term objective in University of Washington are to make an tool and to publish top conference paper including CHI, UIST, and CSCW. My ultimate career goal is to realize a vision that people can solve their own problem by themselves. I would like to do an outstanding contribution to human computer interaction in the future and I believe that University of Washington will surely help my ambition. I am also confident that my knowledge and experience of both social science and software engineering will contribute to your program. I earnestly ask for your favorable consideration in accepting me.
