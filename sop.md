Research Statement
My primary research interest is in the area of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). I believe that one of the most important challenges in HCI over the next decade would be in programming education with emphasis on practical use achieved by collaborative learning. In the past few years, as many educational tools provide new ways to learn how to code interactively, it has been easier for a beginner to attain a basic knowledge of programming. However, there is still a huge gap between acquiring basic knowledge and putting it to practical use. For example, mastering the basics of JavaScript has become relatively easy; on the other hand, building a practical web application with JavaScript is still difficult to achieve without practical experience. This is due to the lack of interactivity in online resources which would allow users to understand the intricacies of more complex applications of basic coding knowledge.
My research goal is to fill this gap by designing a web-based educational platform that is closely integrated with its user community. Both the community and tool design are equally important since the community must be provided with the necessary tools to create various, more advanced  examples of practical application that might intrigue users and aid their learning.
To achieve this goal, during my PhD, I plan to focus on developing the user interface for a web-based  learning environment and its  practical tutorial generator, and then release it online for public use. Following release, the next objective will be to help foster a community for collaborative learning. I believe that, having research experience on both user interface development and community-based social behavior, it is possible for me to achieve.

Research Experience 
The motivation behind this research goal comes from my personal experience in	Mitaka dormitory. I built a programmer community, called Mitakalab, with students who have different academic backgrounds. One of the projects we worked on was an automated watering device with remote monitoring of plant moisture levels. This project was built with a combination of different technologies such as Arduino, Node.js, and WebSocket, as well as knowledge of agriculture. I was amazed that the combination of each person’s knowledge could have such a strong practical application. This experience helped me to realize the importance of collaboration, where the application of the basic knowledge of each individual could be employed in practical development. I also found that, through the use of a separate tool we developed for sharing such knowledge, the collaboration process was simplified significantly. Since then, I have had a strong interest in collaborative learning and its community.

To understand social behavior in a community, I have studied social science through undergraduate and graduate research. After taking several graduate economics and mathematics courses, I did research on social networks and game theory under the supervision of Prof. Michihiro Kandori. I applied my knowledge of game theory to explain how an online platform like YouTube and Twitter grows in popularity, and how its user community forms over time. We found that the level of activity of early users has a crucial role in the increase of the number of its users and contents. We showed that our results are robust to time-series data collected from an experimental online application. The paper was later  accepted at The 10th Conference on Web and Internet Economics (WINE 2014). In order to further understand the structure and growth of a community and how it is influenced by incentive, I chose incentive design as my next field of research. I investigated the incentive structure of GitHub collaboration, and found that the visibility of users’ contribution has a positive impact on the incentive to join and contribute to the developer community. This research into social science helped me to appreciate the importance of community design.

At the same time, I have been working on designing a collaborative web-based tool for the purpose of education called Cumiki. It is difficult for programming beginners to grasp huge source code; on the other hand, creating up-to-date documents is an annoying task. To solve this problem, I developed a tool that helps programmers to create step-by-step and up-to-date tutorials by drag-and-drop code annotation. Cumiki makes it easier to share the knowledge behind source code and accelerate project-based learning within a group. I also developed a project called Interactive Video Tutorial (IVT). IVT records the users' keyboard typing and automatically generates a video tutorial. The learner can not only watch the process of coding, but also learn how to code in-browser interactively. These projects were well received in several demo competitions, including finalist at TechCrunch Tokyo, 1st prize at University of Tokyo Entrepreneur Dojo, and Microsoft Award at Business Model Competition. 

I am currently working on a couple of projects with Prof. Koji Yatani. One is the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for making programming instructions. My current project supports teachers to create effective instruction. I am also working on an information visualization toolkit for non-programmers called Sift. I plan to submit future research to UIST’15.
Moreover, to better prepare myself for the PhD program at UW, I have taken courses regarding computer science including Web Engineering, Ubiquitous Computing, Information Visualization, and Machine Learning as well as Design of Learning Environment. I have also acquired solid practical programming skills by working as a software engineer for the past two years. In addition, I have been accepted as a research intern at Viewpoints Research Institute led by Dr. Alan Kay, and I plan to accumulate research experience on HCI.

Why University of Washington
University of Washington Information School is the best place to pursue my research goal stated above, since DUB group does challenging and interdisciplinary work which really matches my interest. At iSchool, Prof. Andrew Ko  is working on the research problems related to programming education. Most of Prof. Ko's research are in the area of programming education. Gidget is one of the project that Prof. Ko and his PhD student is currently working on. His other projects including Jasper also fit for my research interest. I am also interested in Prof. Jacob Wobbrock and Prof. Jessica Hullman.

Conclusion
As I stated above, I am confident that my diverse research experience, unique backgrounds, and solid programming skills would contribute to research group at UW. program. I also believe that University of Washington will surely help me realize my dream of contributing to HCI research.

Through my research, I want to make it easier for people with different backgrounds to acquire practical software skills, and to leverage their knowledge.
