# Research Statement
I believe that one of the most important issues in HCI for the next decade would be in 
programming education with emphasis on problem solving. A lot of educational tools have provided easier way to gain the basic knowledge of programming. However, there is still gap between having the knowledge and applying these knowledge to create actual product. My research goal is to fill this gap. Through my research, I want to make it easier for people of all background to acquire problem-oriented software and hardware skills, and to leverage their knowledge with the power of collaboration. I believe my research focus surely plays an important role in boosting user-driven innovation. To achieve this goal, I look forward to undertaking PhD at University of Washington, and I want to do research on developing the new way to learn to code, as a significant stepping-stone to be an outstanding researcher in HCI.

# Motivation 
The motivation behind this research goal comes from my personal experience in Mitaka dormitory where I build a programmer community, called Mitakalab, with some friends who have a common interest in programming. As a wide-range background students got involved in the community, a variety of products were invented; machine learning engine for NASA’s crater data, bicycle electronic generator, and automatic plant water-pomp with a collaboration between aerospace engineering, agriculture, and electronic and computer science. Through this experience, I learned the power of collaboration and, at the same time, the difficulty of facilitating collaboration effectively. Especially, I found that the key issues exist in sharing software and hardware skills among different background people and in increasing users’ engagement and contribution. Since then, I have had a strong interest in this issue and decided to do research from the viewpoints of social science and human computer interaction.

# Research Experience in Social Science
As seen in the communities of open source (GitHub), programming education (Scratch), hardware and fabrication (Instructables), and research & development (InnoCentive), building an active community plays an important role in encouraging user-driven innovation.
Through my undergraduate and graduate research, I have been working on human behavior in the communities by focusing on the two: determining the factor of growing community, and designing the incentive to increase users’ engagement and contribution.

To work on the first research question, I did research on game theory under the supervision of Prof. Michihiro Kandori. In my master’s thesis, I applied the knowledge of game theory to analyze human behavior in the online community, especially focused on the growth of user-generated content platform. The motivation behind this research is to understand what determine the fate of a seemingly-similar online communities like Facebook and the other SNS platforms. While previous models can describe S-shaped expansion curve, these models has a limitation in predicting the flopped path. My contribution is to prove there are a threshold point that divide into a success path and a failed path. I also substantiating the model with actual time-series user data gathered from a music recommendation platform where people share their music recommendation. As a result, I showed the model gives a better prediction for users’ behavior. The paper later got accepted at WINE 2014.  As a second paper, I am currently working on the designing incentive of collaboration in GitHub. The paper implies the visibility of users’ contribution has a positive impact on the incentive to join and contribute to the developer community. 


# Research Experience in Human Computer Interaction
The driving force of innovation is combination between different knowledges. However, it is necessary to acquire software and hardware skills when creating innovation. The difficulty of collaboration lies in sharing knowledge effectively. There are some existing services for programming education like Codecademy and Scratch that make it easier to learn to code. However, when I tried to closely observe the leaners’ behavior, it was surprising to see that they did not need a basic programming knowledge, instead, they need to know how to break down their idea into implementable steps.

Therefore, in order to solve this problem, I developed a project called Cumiki, that makes it easier to break down the steps by annotating source code. To extend this approach, I developed Interactive Video Tutorial for learning creating steps. The motivation of these projects is to facilitate for teachers to break down the finished product and helps leaner to understand the steps of creating products. I am honored by some contest and demo competition including finalist at TechCrunch Tokyo, 1st prize at University of Tokyo Entrepreneur Dojo, and Microsoft Award at Business Model Competition.  Becoming aware of potential research opportunity, I am currently working on several projects under the supervision of Prof. Koji Yatani. One is the IDE for making programming instruction. My current project supports teachers to create effective instruction. I am also working on information visualization toolkit for non-programmers. I plan to submit future research to the top conference like UIST 2015 with further experiments and user study.


# Related Courses and Work Experience
While I have a strong background in Economics and Mathematics, to better prepare myself for your rigorous graduate program, I have solidified my foundational knowledge with taking classes like Web Engineering, Ubiquitous Computing, Information Visualization and Machine Learning.  I also have over two years work experience as a software engineer. In addition, I got accepted research intern position at Viewpoints Research Institute led by Dr. Alan Kay, and I plan to boost my research there.

# Why University of Washington
My future research goal is to build a community where people interact each other and create innovative products through its collaboration. To achieve this goal, I believe developing an innovative tool that facilitate people to learn programming easily. If the cost for learning programming are going down, the more and more people can take part in the collaboration, and as a result, the more innovation will happen. The community become a source of inspiration. I believe the most difficult thing to learn is not to learn to code but to come up with the idea. In order to give an inspire, building community is important as well as the software tool itself.

University of Washington Information School is the best place to pursue my research goal stated above, since DUB group does challenging and interdisciplinary work which really matches my interest. At iSchool, Prof. Andrew Ko  is working on the research problems related to programming education. Most of Prof. Ko's research are in the area of programming education. Gidget is one of the project that Prof. Ko and his PhD student is currently working on. His other projects including Jasper also fit for my research interest. I am also interested in Prof. Jacob Wobbrock and Prof. Jessica Hullman.

# Career Objective 
My short term objective in University of Washington are to make an tool and to publish to the top conferences including CHI, UIST, and CSCW. My ultimate career goal is to be an outstanding researcher in HCI and to apply knowledge and skills to make innovative tool that will be used for programming education all over the world. I would like to make a significant contribution to HCI in the future, and I believe that University of Washington will surely help my ambition. I am also confident that my knowledge and experience of both social science and computer science will contribute to your program. I earnestly ask for your favorable consideration in accepting me.
